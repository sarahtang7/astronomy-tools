Various astronomy observation tools!

**AperturePhotometry.py** performs aperture photometry on a given user-provided image. Aperture photometry is the measurement of light which falls within a particular aperture. This program can perform aperture photometry within a square or within a circle using fractional pixels.

In the Centroid folder is **FindCentroid.py**, which takes in a .fits file (eg: -sampleimage.fits-) and returns the centroid of the object.
